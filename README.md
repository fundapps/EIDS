# FEIDS (FundApps Economic Interest Disclosure Standard)

FundApps is creating a global standard for how the investment industry discloses beneficial ownership / economic interests in global companies.

Word documents, Excel sheets, PDFs and even filling in Web forms is legacy technology, the future is API-based filing so that regulators can process machine readable data and be able to proactively act on the received data.

By agreeing on a global standard for disclosure of economic interests, the industry can concentrate on generating alpha and let all the regulatory reporting be taken care of by technology.
